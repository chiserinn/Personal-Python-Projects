#Product Inventory Project
#Create an application which manages an inventory of products. 
#Create a product class which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. 
#Then create an inventory class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.

#What products are in stock 
#How much of each product is available
#When to reorder products
#Which products sell the fastest/slowest

# class Product:
    
#     def __init__ (self):
#         self.price
#         self.id
#         self.qty


# class Inventory:

#     def __init__(self):
