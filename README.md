Here is a list of a bunch of tiny beginner coding projects I went through while learning python.

List of Topics I've Covered & Made Practice Projects For:
- Variables
- Data Types
- Loops
- Functions
- If Statements

List of Topics Covered:
- Object oriented Programming
- Dictionary
- Lists

List of Topics not Covered Yet:
- Algorithms and Data Structures
   -linked lists
   -queues
   -heaps
   -trees
   -graphs

- other python modules + methods

Tips:
- do something interesting/useful
- take projects from online courses
- take simple projects that are scalable later on
- do not copy from stack overflow, try first, look if you can't solve, understand, and try to fix it

What to do Next:
- attempt jobs that push you to code
- join communities
