Here is a list of a bunch of tiny beginner coding projects I went through while learning python. Additionally some other topics I'm planning to learn and cover.

List of Topics I've Covered & Made Practice Projects For:
- Variables
- Data Types
- Loops
- Functions
- If Statements
- Object oriented Programming
- recursive algorithms
- Lists


List of Topics Covered:
- Queues and Stacks
- Classes
- Dictionary
- terminal (bash subsystem linux)
- Arrays


List of Topics not Covered Yet:
- Algorithms and Data Structures
   -hashmaps
   -linked lists
   -heaps
   -trees
   -graphs
- git
- APIs
- other python modules + methods
- bash scripting
- CRUD apps (full stack) -> hackathons
- production level code
- package managers

Tips:
- 
- do something interesting/useful
- take projects from online courses
- take simple projects that are scalable later on
- do not copy from stack overflow, try first, look if you can't solve, understand, and try to fix it

What to do Next:
- attempt jobs that push you to code
- join communities
- leetcode
- hackathons
